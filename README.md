# Tutorial for Unstructured.io. Code from Deeplearning.AI's course on Unstructured

Includes
- Normalizing elements of several documents (PPTX, PDF, MD)
- Processing Embedded Tables
- Chunking text by section
- Using ChromaDB to store chunks in a collection
- Using Metadata to filter


On the contrary to the Unstructured API used in the course, I set up local Docker image running as an API.
Also, apart from using OpenAI-based models, I used local Embeddings and LLM via Ollama.
